# Cryptography

First the user needs to add both the executable and the db file in one folder. Followed by that, the user runs the program where they are displayed with the main page that includes signup, and login. When the user chooses to sign up, they are required to fill in the username, name , and a password with minimum length 8 characters. No 2 users can have the same username.

When the user chooses to login, they are required to enter the registered credentials, if the credentials donâ€™t exist, the user is displayed with an error message. Then the machine starts.

The user is displayed with their private key, and they input text, which we then press the encrypt button to do it. Then we copy the encrypted output, paste it into the encrypted input, then press decrypt to display it to the user in the end like the original message.
